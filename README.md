# Fast React Pizza Co. 🍕

A fast and simple pizza ordering app built with React!

This project is part of **The Ultimate React Course** by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. I built this app while following the course to practice advanced React concepts like React Router (with data loading), Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and state management.

## Live Demo
[Live Demo](https://fast-react-pizza.AtaDev.ir) 

## Features
- Display pizza menu with images, prices, and details
- Add pizzas to the cart
- Manage cart (increase/decrease quantity, remove items)
- Priority orders
- Track order status with a fake API
- Responsive and beautiful design with Tailwind CSS
- No login required (quick ordering!)

## Technologies Used
- **React** (with Vite for fast builds)
- **React Router v6** (for routing and data loaders)
- **Redux Toolkit** (global state management for the cart)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
- **JavaScript** (ES6+)
